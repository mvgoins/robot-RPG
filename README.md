# robot-RPG
dragon quest, but with robots

This was a little learning project for me (twitter @mvgoins, email mvgoins@gmail.com). Made over the week 7/12/15 - 7/18/15.

Game made for love2d 0.9.2 at https://love2d.org/

Sound effects were made with Bfxr at http://www.bfxr.net/

Thanks to the folk in #love@irc.oftc.net for answering some random questions.

To play this game, install love2d, download the game zip, extract it. You can then either either run it
through the command line, or zip the -contents- of the folder and rename the file extension from 
.zip to .love.

STORY:
You are a robot who has just woken up in a cave. You are next to a heavy, locked door. 

CONTROLS:
Arrow keys move you around and navigate menus.
ENTER/RETURN will select a thing in a menu; in the dungeon, it functions as a CHECK short-cut.
ESCAPE should back you out of menus.
You need to level up the Harm skill at least one time to be able to move the big rock.

If this were to grow up to be a real game I would want to add the following (and probably more besides):

* title, intro, and game-over art
* combat screen art
* complete audio (more sfx, music tracks)
* animations
* more enemies
* non-combat encounters
* lot more, you know, game (dungeon floors, outside stuff)
* more secrets ("check" random corners for things, and so on)
* probably rework the map view to interact with a "sensors" upgrade
* many menu adjustments
* ...and so on

The code is super messy! Learned a lot as I went along. I'm not sure if you'll be able to learn anything from it,
but take a look if you're so inclined.
